# ECX 4.0 21 Days of Code Challenge - Day 5

## Description
This repository contains the solution for Day 5 of the Engineering Career Expo 4.0 (ECX 4.0) 21 days of code challenge. The challenge was to write a script that takes a string of text and cleans it, removing all punctuation, converting to lowercase, and extracting individual words into an array.

## Solution
I solved the challenge using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The core logic of the solution involves iterating through the string and checking for punctuation marks using regular expression patterns, extracting the punctuations if present, converting the string to lowercase, and splitting the sentence into words. I utilized array methods and the `replace()`, `split()`, `toLowerCase()` method on strings to achieve the desired output.
